These are the commands I used:
#+begin_src sql
sqlite3 pets_database.db

CREATE TABLE cats (
id INTEGER PRIMARY_KEY,
name TEXT,
age INTEGER,
breed TEXT
)

INSERT INTO cats (name, age, breed)
VALUES ("Maru", 3, "Scottish Fold");

INSERT INTO cats (name, age, breed)
VALUES ("Hana", 1, "Tabby");

CREATE TABLE owners (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT);

ALTER TABLE cats ADD COLUMN owner_id INTEGER;

INSERT INTO owners (name) VALUES ("mugumogu");

SELECT * FROM owners;

# These commands will associate 'Mugumogu' to the 'Hana' and 'Maru' cats:
UPDATE cats SET owner_id = 1 WHERE name = "Maru";
UPDATE cats SET owner_id = 1 WHERE name = "Hana";

SELECT * FROM cats WHERE owner_id = 1;
#+end_src

NOTE: The key goal is when there is a 'one to many' relationship, you need to then place the 'foreign key' on the 'many' objects

Example:
- There may be multiple cats, but there can only be one owner for each
- There may be multiple posts, but there can be only be one owner for each
